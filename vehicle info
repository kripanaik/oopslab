16. .Write a program to create a class named Vehicle having protected instance variables regnNumber, speed, color, ownerName and a method showData ( ) to show “This is a vehicle class”. Inherit the Vehicle class into subclasses named Bus and Car having individual private instance variables routeNumber in Bus and manufacturerName in Car and both of them having showData ( ) method showing all details of Bus and Car respectively with content of the super class’s showData ( ) method

// Base class Vehicle
class Vehicle {
    // Method to start the engine (base implementation)
    void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Engine of the vehicle starts.");
    }

    // Method to stop the engine (base implementation)
    void stopEngine() {
        System.out.println("Engine of the vehicle stops.");
    }
}

// Subclass Car inheriting from Vehicle
class Car extends Vehicle {
    // Method to start the engine (override)
    @Override
    void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Car engine starts with ignition key.");

    void stopEngine() {
        System.out.println("Car engine stops with ignition key.");
